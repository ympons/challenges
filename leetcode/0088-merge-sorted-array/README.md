# 88. Merge Sorted Array

Given two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array.

The number of elements initialized in `nums1` and `nums2` are `m` and `n` respectively. You may assume that `nums1` has a size equal to `m + n` such that it has enough space to hold additional elements from `nums2`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

**Constraints:**
- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^9`
