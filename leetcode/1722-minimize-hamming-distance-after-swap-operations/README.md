# 1722. Minimize Hamming Distance After Swap Operations

You are given two integer arrays, `source` and `target`, both of length `n`. You are also given an array `allowedSwaps` where each `allowedSwaps[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you are allowed to swap the elements at index `ai` and index `bi` *(0-indexed)* of array `source`. Note that you can swap elements at a specific pair of indices **multiple times** and in **any order**.

The **Hamming distance** of two arrays of the same length, `source` and `target`, is the number of positions where the elements are different. Formally, it is the number of indices `i` for `0 <= i <= n-1` where `source[i] != target[i]` **(0-indexed)**.

Return ***the minimum Hamming distance** of `source` and `target` after performing any amount of swap operations on array `source`*.

**Example:**
```
Input: source = [1,2,3,4], target = [2,1,4,5], allowedSwaps = [[0,1],[2,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: source can be transformed the following way:
- Swap indices 0 and 1: source = [2,1,3,4]
- Swap indices 2 and 3: source = [2,1,4,3]
The Hamming distance of source and target is 1 as they differ in 1 position: index 3.
```

**Constraints:**
- `n == source.length == target.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= source[i], target[i] <= 10^5`
- `0 <= allowedSwaps.length <= 10^5`
- `allowedSwaps[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
- `ai != bi`
