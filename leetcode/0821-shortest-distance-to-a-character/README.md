# 821. Shortest Distance to a Character

Given a string `s` and a character `c` that occurs in `s`, return *an array of integers `answer` where `answer.length == s.length` and `answer[i]` is the shortest distance from `s[i]` to the character `c` in `s`*.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "loveleetcode", c = "e"
Output: [3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s[i]` and `c` are lowercase English letters
- `c` occurs at least once in `s`
