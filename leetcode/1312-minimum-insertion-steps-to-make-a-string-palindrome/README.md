# 1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome

Given a string `s`. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.

Return *the minimum number of steps* to make `s` palindrome.

A **Palindrome String** is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "zzazz"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we don't need any insertions.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "no"
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 500`
- All characters of `s` are lower case English letters.
