# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, *delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list*. Return *the linked list **sorted** as well*.

Example:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order
