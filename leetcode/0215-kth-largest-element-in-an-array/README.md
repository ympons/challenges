# 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

Find the `kth` largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.

**Example:**
```
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5
```

**Note:**
You may assume `k` is always valid, `1 ≤ k ≤ array.length`
