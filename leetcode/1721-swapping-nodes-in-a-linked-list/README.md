# 1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List

You are given the `head` of a linked list, and an integer `k`.

Return *the head of the linked list after **swapping** the values of the `kth` node from the beginning and the `kth` node from the end (the list is **1-indexed**)*.

Example:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
